 * The PipeFilterInterface is the base interface of the Pipe&Filter pattern pipeline.
 * Filters can be chained by connecting multiple PipeFilterPatterns in a list to form a Pipe.
 * A pipe has to start with an active filter, the PipeSource. The source will generate the input
 * to be propagated through the pipe. The pipe should end with a PipeSink which will end the chain.
